# ZORALab's Hestia (Go Programming Language)

[![ZORALab's Hestia](.src/logos/zoralab-hestia_1200x340.svg)](#)

One Peaceful Frontend+Backend Software Library Suite - Go Programming Language.

The project is to unify all common libraries and data structure into 1 single
repository for highest attributes of reusablity, smoother learning curves, and a
more wholesome tools alignments. Develop and learn advanced products easily with
less worries about supply chain problems.

## Why It Matters
This project was initiated primarily because of:

1. **Be done with supply chain threats** caused by geo-political nuisance, dirty
   after the fact shenanigans, or cut-throat charges.
2. **Simple to integrate** with a simple `zip` archive format + its GPG
   cryptography signature for integrity checking.
3. **Deploy everywhere** from servers to microcontrollers where anything that
   can compute.

## Roadmaps
This project is a huge and ambitious one. It aims to be inter-operable between
**Go**, **TinyGo**, and **Nim** covering outputs like `Backend`, `Frontend UI`,
`PWA`, `WASM`, and `Embedded` (microcontrollers). We divided the tasks into
phases viewable in our
[GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/ZORALab/projects/6).
